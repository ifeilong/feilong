/**
 * Concrete implementations of this class implement actions to be taken when a corresponding nested pattern of XML
 * elements has been matched.
 * <p>
 * Writing a custom Rule is considered perfectly normal when using Digester, and is encouraged whenever the default set
 * of Rule classes don't meet your requirements; the digester framework can help process xml even when the built-in
 * rules aren't quite what is needed. Creating a custom Rule is just as easy as subclassing
 * javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet for webapps, or javax.swing.Action for GUI applications.
 * <p>
 * If a rule wishes to manipulate a digester stack (the default object stack, a named stack, or the parameter stack)
 * then it should only ever push objects in the rule's begin method and always pop exactly the same number of objects
 * off the stack during the rule's end method. Of course peeking at the objects on the stacks can be done from anywhere.
 * <p>
 * Rule objects should be stateless, ie they should not update any instance member during the parsing process. A rule
 * instance that changes state will encounter problems if invoked in a "nested" manner; this can happen if the same
 * instance is added to digester multiple times or if a wildcard pattern is used which can match both an element and a
 * child of the same element. The digester object stack and named stacks should be used to store any state that a rule
 * requires, making the rule class safe under all possible uses.
